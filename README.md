## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

## What was the key point and the hard part?
 
First , I try it with quick sort, but time complexity gets over.

I think that is because quick sort's O time complexity is O(n^2).

So I try it with build-in function (sort) with vecter and that works.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
Thank you for visiting this github!
